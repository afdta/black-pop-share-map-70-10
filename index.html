  <h1 style="margin:0rem;">Change in the black share of the population, 1970 to 2010</h1>

    <p style="margin:0rem 0rem 1rem 0rem;"><em>6,000+ cities</em></p>
    <p style="border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;"><strong>How to read this</strong><br/><em>(Sorry, legends are tedious to create and I don't want to burn time on that if we go in a different direction)</em></p>
    <p>Line angle indicates change in black share:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Vertical, pointed UP: <strong>30+ percentage point increase in black share</strong></li>
      <li>Horizontal/flat: No change in black share</li>
      <li>Vertical, pointed DOWN: <strong>30+ percentage point decrease in black share</strong></li>
      <li>E.g. +/-45 degree line is +/- 15 percentage point decrease, and so on</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Line and dot color indicates <span style="color:#08519c;font-weight:bold;">gain</span> / <span style="color:#a63603;font-weight:bold;";>loss</span> in black population share</p>
    <p>Dot size corresponds with total population in 2010</p>

    <p style="border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;">Notes</p>
    <p>This is very much a draft, though I think it is the best of my early sketches. It doesn't directly depict shifts in the white population, though that is represented implicitely (e.g. if the black share increases, the non-black share decreases, and vice versa).</p>
    <p>I think this representation shows promise. The challenge is that there's a lot of information to convey. E.g. this map doesn't depict the absolute size (25 pct. pt. change in a small city is the same here, visually, as 25 pct. pt. change in a big city) or the direction of population shifts (e.g. increasing/decreasing population), so it doesn't provide those nuances. We could provide additional filters that the user could "play with" or we could change the map as the narrative on the site proceeds (like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/elections/how-trump-pushed-the-election-map-to-the-right.html">this</a>)</p>
    <p>We don't have to do this as a map. Depending on the findings, a chart like the "butterfly" plot you shared (which I really like!) might be the best way to do this.</p>
